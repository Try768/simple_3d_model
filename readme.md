# this is my core project
you can fork it and use but you need to remember 
that this code isnt optimization yet
but maybe this code can help you making 3d game angine or whatever
you can build it in windows cmd using msvc by run build.bat
after that type ngasu.exe (you can change the name file) 
and the program will start

## what is in the code
just some simple 3d engine program that include 
rotating and movement

note:
press 'p' to activate rotation of the camera
i comment all the failure code as a reference 
and to remind me how much i failed
